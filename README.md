# Chords Trainer

A python app that helps you train your chords on the piano (or any midi instrument actually).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

I'll add something to make it easier to select the relevant midi interface at some point. For now, you'll have to change the value in `__init__.py` :

```python
inport = mido.open_input(interfaces[1]) # This value (1)
```

Then run:

```bash
$ chords-trainer
```

You can click on the `train mode` button to switch to train mode. In this mode, the app shows you a random chord, if you play the right chord it goes to a next one.

You can change the `TRAIN_DIFFICULTY` value in `__init__.py`, it's a number between 0 and 2. 0 is easiest, 2 is hardest.


## TODO
- [ ] Add a way to select the midi interface (just a button to iterate over interfaces)
- [ ] Add a way to change the difficulty in the app
- [ ] Include flat notes
- [ ] Global code overhaul (very dirty right now)
